Analysis of the 2018 article 'Deep learning of aftershock patterns following large earthquakes' by Phoebe M. R. DeVries, Fernanda Viégas, Martin Wattenberg & Brendan J. Meade, published in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0438-y).

This repo includes, chronologically:

(1a) notebook folder related to my January 2019 Coursera/IBM Advanced Data Science Capstone project: **Aftershock pattern prediction based on earthquake rupture data for improved seismic hazard assessment**

(1b) dataset folder and srcmod2.py used in (1a).

(2) ref_Mignan&Broccardo_IWANN2019.pdf, the article **A Deeper Look into ‘Deep Learning
of Aftershock Patterns Following Large Earthquakes’: Illustrating First Principles in Neural Network Physical Interpretability** published in [Advances in Computational Intelligence](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-20521-8_1) and presented at the International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (IWANN19) in June 2019. This paper results from (1);

(3) Our follow-up study, published in Nature in 2019 and titled **One neuron versus deep learning in aftershock prediction**, where we go one step further in the analysis, showing that a logistic regression (one neuron) performs as well as, if not better than any more complex neural network [Mignan & Broccardo, 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1582-8);
